      <h1>Link, Hero Of Time</h1>
        <p>The Legendary Hero, Link, is a mystery to most. His origin is usually just as vague. Those who encounter him, know him only as the 'Hero Of Time.'
          He is always there whenever a threat to life comes. His various incarnations through the land of Hyrule always seem to be right when he is needed most, and whenever a princess needs saving.
